Prince Shoutoku would be venerated throughout history as a man who had reached great enlightenment, a great and noble hero who was able to bring Buddhism to the great Japan.

Good morning, class.
Normally, I would like to jump directly into our studies, but...
I'm actually very impressed with all of you! There's a few days before the end of the year, and we've already finished all of our material.
So, today, we'll be engaging in a topic of my personal interest.
Still in the realm of history, of course, but something I hope you will find fascinating alongside me.
Here, let me show you something.
[old ten grand bill]
This is a fairly old ten-thousand-yen bill. Can anyone tell me who is pictured on the front?
[raise hand]
>Oh, that's a lot of hands...
>Hm... go ahead, Kochiya-san.
>[text entry]
>[correct]
>>"Oh, well done!"
>[incorrect]
>>"Ah, I'm sorry, that's not it."
>>"Anyone else want to try?"
>[the new 10k yen guy]
>>"Oh, i'm sorry, it must be pretty hard to see from back there."
>>"No, that's who's on the present version of this bill."
>>"Does anyone else want to try?"
[do not]
>Let's see...
>Hm... go ahead, Yamake-san.
>"Is it Prince Shoutoku?"

Yes, that's it!
He will be our topic of discussion for today.
This isn't for a grade, so don't stress yourselves to remember everything.
You don't have to participate, but if you do...
Well, maybe this bill here can be turned into snacks for the whole class.
...I see you've all started to look a bit more in my direction.
Let's get on with the lesson.

Long, long ago, at the dawn of the Asuka era, Japan was splintered.
Splintered people, scattered across the native lands.
Splintered cultures, only beginning upon great works of art and philosophy.
Splintered faiths, as Buddhism and Taoism both grew to be taught by the blade instead of merely by words.
One very, very unique man took up the stage of such an era and took it upon himself to piece together the fragmented scene.

"Oboro. Setsunaga."

"..."
"Sir."

"Yeah, sure."
"Rejoice, for you two will be joining me."
"I will lead us through a stealth operation that will allow us to pick off key enemies that may cause the main group trouble."

"..."
"Understood."

"Let us be off, then."

Early in his life, Prince Shoutoku led a great conflict of faiths, culminating in the battle of Shigisan, the mountain Shigi.
For a person I've just said is sort of a hero, that sounds rather violent, doesn't it?
Well, that's just the way things tended to be back then. Ultimately, many believe it was the better choice in the end, as it was a key factor in the unification of Japan in this era.
Like pulling off a bandaid, maybe?
Would anyone like to guess which faith the prince sided with?

[raise hand]
>Oh, Kochiya-san.
>What do you think?
>[Buddhism]
>>"Correct!"
>>"Prince Shoutoku was the driving force behind the spread of Buddhism throughout Japan."
>>"He is even said to have met with legendary Buddhist figures from beyond the country."
>>"Of course, this is from a very long past era. Specific records are few and far between, so we don't know for sure."
>[Taoism]
>>"Close! Taoism is the faith the prince was in conflict with."
>>"He was a Buddhist, through and through."
>>"So stalwart was his faith that he is enshrined even now in certain temples."
>>"If you get a chance, find and make a visit to one! Maybe I could even give extra credit if you wrote about the experience, haha."
>[Shinto]
>>"A good guess!"
>>"It's said that the prince paid service to and respected the Shinto faith, but it was not what he is known for."
>>"Prince Shoutoku spearheaded the spread of Buddhism throughout Japan."
>[Christianity]
>>"Um... no. Christianity wasn't introduced to Japan until over a millenia later."
>>"Have you been paying attention to the rest of the class properly?"
>>"There are people who have likened Prince Shoutoku to Jesus Christ in the context of Buddhism in his kindness and spearheading of faith, but I don't think there are that many other similarities."
>>"Oh yes, the correct answer was Buddhism."
[do not, or got it correct last time]
>"Higashikata-san."
>"It was Taoism, wasn't it?"
>"Close! Taoism is the faith the prince was in conflict with."
>"He was a Buddhist, through and through."
>"So stalwart was his faith that he is enshrined even now in certain temples."
>"If you get a chance, maka a visit to one! Maybe I could even give extra credit if you wrote about the experience, haha."

Regardless, yes, Prince Shoutoku ran an influential campaign representing Buddhism against Taoism.
The battle of Shigisan ended in a symbolic victory that empowered Buddhism to sweep across the whole country.
