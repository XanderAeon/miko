General Information: The Lisa Core Movement script that this game is built to show
off took an entire month of work to make, and this game took about a week and half
to make. It's relatively short; you will probably beat it in less than half an hour.
This game shows off all the major features of the Lisa Core Movement Script
as well as some of the things that are made possible by it. This tech demo is
intended to show what the script does, why you would want to use it, and
how to use it properly. Enjoy!



Important Notes (for Developers):
First - This game is intended to be played from IN THE RPGMAKER PROJECT. This is
so you can go to each room, explore it, and then check how the room was made in
the engine. There is a save spot in each room because of this. I recommend that
developers should either open the game through the project on the first runthrough,
or play the game fully once "normally" and then again looking at it through the project.

Second - There is a key item that teleports you to the debug room given to you
by a strange unshaded creature in the top right corner of the first map
(used the debug-walk with the CTRL key to get there). The debug room has some
testing tools set up, and has teleports to every map in the game.

Third - In the top left of each map is an event that contains a bunch of comments about
the purpose of each map, and some insight into how different mechanics and features
on the map were implemented. I reccommend reading them.

Fourth - Contained in the files is a version of the Lisa Core Movement script
that has more "standard" settings to start off with then the version
of the script used for this game. **THIS VERSION MAY NOT BE FULLY UPDATED**, however,
because I may not go back and update this game's folder files when I update
the script. To get the most recent version, please see the "Other" section
down below.

Fifth - There are 2 other scripts that I also made for this game:
"Lisa NPC Talk Options" and "ATS Message Options Lisa Addon", which are
2 dialogue/talking based scripts. Check them out in the scripts section of
the project file if you are interested in those. To get the most recent version(s),
please see the "Other" section down below.
