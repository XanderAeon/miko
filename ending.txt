"Why, pray tell, do you use the image of one who is now your enemy instead of the one that was on your side?"

"Despite how it may seem, I have the utmost respect for your ability, and very much admire it when it is used in more honest ways."

"However, she specifically requested this design."

"Why, how kind. I'll have to pay her a visit as thanks."

"Her plan proceeds smoothly, then."

"Indeed."
"Would you kindly help me with it? Your physical enhancement magic would be nice to have."

"...Hm? Help you with what?"

"Why, taking my statue to Senkai, of course."
"Don't you think it would make a nice centerpiece, instead of being on the outskirts of a drab temple?"
